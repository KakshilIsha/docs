# Global Program Registration System (Global PRS)

## Overview

The primary goal behind building the Global PRS was to have all Isha programs under one system. To achieve this, we focused on two key factors: stability and flexibility.

The system is designed to be stable enough for global systems to use it and provide consistent performance, while being flexible enough to handle all different features required across regions.

Built in a highly modular fashion, Global PRS ensures each component can be managed and scaled independently, while allowing programs to be fully customizable by the business teams.

## Primary Users

  <Card title="Participants" icon="user">
    People who register for the programs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Program Setup Team" icon="gear">
    Team which sets up the program (can also be Volunteers/Coordinators)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Volunteers/Coordinators" icon="users">
    Team executing the program (Ground Volunteers, Ishangas, Check-in Volunteers)

## Key Points

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Layered Architecture">
    The system separates concerns by dividing functionalities into distinct layersâ€”API, frontend, Odoo backend, and database. This ensures that each layer can scale independently and leverage its unique strengths.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Modular Design">
    Components are designed to be generic and modular. This modularity allows for updates or changes in one part of the system without necessitating a complete overhaul, enhancing maintainability and efficiency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scalability">
    The architecture allows for horizontal scaling, particularly in the API layer, to handle increased load without stressing the Odoo systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Decoupled Workers">
    Odoo workers are decoupled from the Odoo server, providing the flexibility to integrate other platforms for backend jobs in the future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Layer">
    A separate external layer handles all integrations, allowing teams to build and manage necessary connections with other systems independently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    Enhanced security measures are enforced at the API layer to ensure that only authorized systems can submit forms and access data.
  </Accordion>

## Guiding Principles

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Participant-First Approach" icon="user-check">
    Focus on participant needs when designing all aspects of the system, including what volunteers need to help participants.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple and Clean Experience" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Ensure the system is intuitive and easy to navigate, requiring minimal orientation for new internal users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stability & Scale" icon="server">
    The system should be able to scale up while staying stable and performing reliably.

## Sample Data Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Program Setup in Odoo">
    Business team configures programs (forms, flows, fields) in Odoo, and the data is stored in PostgreSQL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pushing to Cache">
    Once saved, the form configurations are cached in Redis, reducing database queries and speeding up access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetching Configurations via API">
    When a user accesses the registration form, the API retrieves the configuration from Redis and sends it to the frontend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rendering the Form">
    The frontend dynamically renders the form using the JSON configuration, providing a flexible and responsive interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Form Submission">
    Users fill out the form and submit it. The submission is sent to the API, with security measures like authentication for private APIs and WAF for public ones.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Saved to Database">
    The API processes the submission, storing basic info in PostgreSQL tables and dynamic responses as JSON.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Registrations in Odoo">
    Program teams can immediately access submissions in Odoo and perform necessary actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delayed Tasks via Workers">
    Tasks like sending confirmation emails or updating external systems are handled by Celery workers asynchronously.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connected Apps">
    Other apps (e.g., MyMedic) use the same API to render forms and manage registrations.
  </Step>
</Steps>
