# System Architecture

The Global PRS is built with a layered architecture that separates concerns and allows each component to scale independently. This design ensures stability, flexibility, and maintainability across the entire system.

## Architecture Overview

## System Layers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Odoo Layer">
    **Details:**
    - **Program Setup:** Configures programs, including events, forms, pages, sections, and fields, with logic configuration managed through Odoo.
    - **Registrations Viewing:** Handles registration submissions, where responses are stored as JSON objects with static fields. This allows for flexibility in managing dynamic form data.
    
    **Systems:**
    - **Simplified Form Creation System:** Provides a templating system for forms and fields, enabling easy setup and reuse across programs.
    - **Registrations Management System:** Manages participants, backend operations, and all aspects of program registrations and form submissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Layer">
    **Technology:** PostgreSQL
    
    **Details:**
    - The system's data is stored across multiple regions (DB Region 1, DB Region 2, DB Region 3, DB Region 4), with separate UAT databases for testing purposes (UAT DB: 1-4).
    - Supports multi-region storage to improve resilience and availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache Layer">
    **Technology:** Redis
    
    **Details:**
    - **Storage Mechanism:** Stores key-value pairs where the key is a combination of ProgramID, FlowID, and FlowStepID.
    - **Master Data:** Uses Redis lists to store cached master data, with backups and persistence options enabled to ensure data durability and recovery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Worker Layer">
    **Technology:** Celery
    
    **Details:**
    - Handles asynchronous tasks, including delayed and scheduled tasks for updating the Odoo system and managing background processes.
    - **Odoo RPC:** Uses remote procedure calls (RPC) to interact with the Odoo system, ensuring updates are processed efficiently in the background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Layer">
    **Details:**
    - Contains multiple layers, including:
      - **Get API Layer:** Handles fetching data from the system for different forms and integrations.
      - **Post API Layer:** Manages data submissions from participants or external systems.
      - **Security Layer:** Ensures authentication and data protection.
      - **Integrations:** Links external systems like ERP, VMS, and others with the core PRS platform, enabling seamless data flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Frontend Layer">
    **Technology:** React with TypeScript (TS)
    
    **Details:**
    - The frontend is powered by React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    - Uses TypeScript to enhance code reliability and maintainability.
    - **Rendering Engine:** Efficiently renders the forms and registration views, allowing users to interact with the system.
    - **Theming:** Supports customizable theming to match the branding and user experience of the platform.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Database Structure

The database is laid out to efficiently manage events (programs), registrations, and forms, with relationships connecting the event-related data to the forms and flows required for participant registration and management.

### Database Layout and Relationships

- **Event Model**: Central to the database, connected to multiple tables like EventFlow, EventTicket, EventCategory, etc., through one-to-many relationships.
- **EventFlow and EventFlowStep**: Define the participant flow for an event, with each EventFlow containing multiple EventFlowStep records.
- **Form Models**: Organize the structure of forms, with FormForm containing pages (FormPage), and pages containing sections (FormSection). Sections hold fields (FormField), and fields may have associated choices.
- **Registration Data**: Captured via the EventRegistrationMixin, connecting participant details to events and flows.

### Additional Systems

- **Datadog**: For audit logging and monitoring
- **Mixpanel**: For analytics tracking
- **Freshdesk**: For support ticket management
- **ClickUp**: For project management
- **OpenAPI**: For API documentation generated by Litestar
- **AWS S3**: For artifact storage
- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipelines

## Security Architecture

Security is a critical aspect of the Global PRS, with multiple layers of protection to ensure data integrity and user privacy.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication">
    - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Issue signed JWTs for secure, stateless authentication between clients and the API.
    - **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to restrict access based on the user's role or permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Gateway">
    - **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Limit the number of requests from a client to prevent abuse (DDoS protection).
    - **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple API instances for stability and high availability.
    - **IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Restrict access to the API based on IP addresses or ranges.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Encryption">
    - **Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL):** Enforce HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted during transit.
    - **Data Encryption at rest & transport (optional):** For sensitive data like Aadhaar card information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Input Validation">
    - **Input Validation:** Strictly validate incoming API requests for expected data types, lengths, and formats.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Escape or sanitize data that might be reflected back to the user.
    - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** Implement CSRF tokens for APIs that modify state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Audit Logging">
    - **Access Logs:** Log every API request with details like IP address, user-agent, user ID, endpoint accessed, and time.
    - **Audit Trails:** Keep logs of sensitive operations for accountability and tracking.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Security Tools

- **Isha SSO**: For login and authentication
- **Cloud-flare**: For Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- **DataDog**: For audit, logging, and monitoring
